- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexkltrinh
- I'm a mechanical engineering student studying @ University of Waterloo. 
- I am always looking for ways to hone my skills in engineering. 
- Programming is one way I strive in doing this, so the extent of my programming can range from personal projects to any coursework.
